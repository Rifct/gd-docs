# Secrets

Secrets are 11 character strings used to validate if requests to the server were from a Geometry Dash client. Rather than generating a new secret for each request sent to the server, RobTop opted with hardcoding these secrets and slightly obfuscating them instead to stop people finding them.

### Table of Secrets

| Secret        | Type                 |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| `Wmfd2893gb7` | Common               |
| `Wmfv3899gc9` | Account, Multiplayer |
| `Wmfv2898gc9` | Level                |
| `Wmfp3879gc3` | Mod                  |
| `Wmfx2878gb9` | Admin                |

### Account Secret

> There are 5 endpoints which use the `Account Secret`. The Account Secret was created for endpoints that deal with <u>important account features such as save data and privacy settings</u>. However, some unused code in 2.2 also reveals that the secret could be used for the upcoming multiplayer mode, but this is subject to change. Below is a table of each endpoint which uses the Account Secret.

### Moderator Secret

> There are only 2 endpoints which use the `Moderator Secret`. These endpoints allow hand-picked users called moderators to send in-game levels to the server which then have a chance to earn a star rating. Below are the endpoints in question.

### Admin Secret

> In the client for Geometry Dash 1.9, RobTop mistakenly included the secret for `Admin Endpoints` inside of a function. Admin Endpoints are only accessible for game admins and they make direct changes in-game that affect everyone.

Below is a screenshot of the Admin Secret being created from Geometry Dash 1.9. RobTop split it into 6 segments to obfuscate it.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wyliemaster/gddocs/master/assets/screenshots/admin_secret.png" class="padded decomp">

Currently, the Admin Secret no longer works as RobTop became aware of it.

<!-- todo: clean-up + explain reasoning clearer-->

<!-- TODO: Put these into tables! We love tables :3 -->

## Secret Structure

<!-- TODO: A more accurate description would be W|xxx|xxxx|g|x|x -->

A Secret is split into 5 components and can be divided as such: `x|xxx|xxxx|xx|x`. From analysing the available secrets that we have access too, we have a general idea of what each component may represent.

> **Note:** *The following is based on analysis using the endpoints the secret is used by as well as the status in the community one is required to have in order to access them. **<u>None of the information below has been proven</u>***

- The first component of a Secret is always a `W`.

- The second component denotes the permissions level of the user.
    - `mfd` is endpoints that anyone can use.
    - `mfv` is endpoints that anyone can use but, they handle important information regarding a users account - save data and levels.
    - `mfp` is endpoints that are restricted to a select few individuals - Geometry Dash Moderators.
    - `mfx` is endpoints that are restricted to everyone except Game Admins.

- The third component is a 4-digit number which it's purpose is unknown.
    - `2893`
    - `3899`
    - `2898`
    - `3879`
    - `2878`

<!-- TODO: In the fourth component, `g` is presumably a constant due to the way it's formatted in-code: -->
<!-- CCString::createWithFormat("%c%s%s%c%c%s", (char)'W', (char*)premissionsRequired, (char*)unkNumbers, (char)'g', (char)endpointPurpose, (char*)endpointPower) -->

- The fourth component denotes the purpose of the secret.
    - `gb` is general use.
    - `gc` is specialised use - managing accounts, sending levels, deleting levels.

<!-- TODO: Due to the 5th component being a char array, there's a chance that it could be longer -->

- The fifth component is overall power the endpoints have:
    - `3` being able to submit data that can greatly affect in-game levels,
    - `7` being able to perform general activities on the server,
    - `9` being able to alter accounts and remove levels from the server.
