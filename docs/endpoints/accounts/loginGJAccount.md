> [!NOTE]
> The `sID` parameter is only sent to the servers if the player is logging into their account from the steam release of Geometry Dash. From what has been observed, it has not been utilised.

> [!NOTE]
> Previously, the plaintext `password` field was sent, but since 2.2, that has changed presumably for security reasons.
