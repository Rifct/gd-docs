# Server User Resource

## Users

Each player of Geometry Dash has their own profile which includes various different elements such as in-game stats, icons and even socials.

A typical user server response is structured with a `key:value:key:value` pairing and is then split with a `|`

Keys indicated with an asterisk (*) are only returned from the [getGJUserInfo20](/endpoints/users/getGJUserInfo20) endpoint. Conversely, keys 6, 9, 14, & 15 are only returned by user search endpoints ([getGJUsers20](/endpoints/users/getGJUsers20), [getGJScores20](/endpoints/users/getGJScores20))

### Trivia

- Setting Key `29` to `0` stops most aspects of your profile from loading

- Key `27` is impossible to recieve from the server as there is no way for the server to know what the player's `streak` is

- Key `15` represented the player's `streak` prior to 2.0; the `2` it now returns would have corresponded to the rainbow trail
