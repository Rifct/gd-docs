# Server Comment Resource

Comments are public messages players can leave on levels, lists, and profiles. There are **two** types of comments: `Level Comments` and `Account Comments`

> - `Level Comments` can be found by clicking the `i` button on the right of a level or list menu; you can also view a specific player's comments by clicking the comment icon on their profile. `Level Comments` can be up to **100 characters** in length without external tools
> - `Account Comments` can be found on player profiles. `Account Comments` can be up to **140 characters** in length without external tools


## Comment Object

`Level Comments` contain a comment object and a user object split by a colon `:`. Level comments are returned by endpoints [getGJComments21](/endpoints/comments/getGJComments21.md) and [getGJCommentHistory](/endpoints/comments/getGJCommentHistory)

`Account Comments` contain only a comment object with keys `2, 4, 6, 9`. Account comments are returned by [getGJAccountComments20](/endpoints/comments/getGJAccountComments20)

Comment objects are structured with a `key~value~key~value` pairing, with each comment being split with a pipe `|`

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component. A list of all known keys can be found in the table below

## Comment Bans

If a user violates [the commenting rules](https://imgur.com/a/US0Biaj), they can be banned from posting comments.
> As of Geometry Dash version 2.11, there are 2 different types of bans:
> - Permanent Bans - Only way to recieve one is from RobTop directly. The server response to trigger this is `-10`
> - Temporary Bans - Elder Moderators and RobTop can enforce these onto players. The server response to trigger temporary bans is split into 3 components `temp_{length}_{reason}`

### Temporary Ban Structure

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `temp`    | is used by the game to identify if the user is banned |
| `length`  | The duration of the ban in seconds |
| `reason`  | The reason the user was banned |

## Trivia

- The `User String` uses the same response parser that [player profiles](/resources/server/user) use

- The only example of `Account Comments` displaying colour is [RobTop's](https://gdbrowser.com/u/71) profile. This is because RobTop hardcoded the colour into his accountID of `71`
